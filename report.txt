Binary Tree Traversal and Construction - Report

Objective:
The goal of this project was to implement traversal algorithms (preorder, inorder, postorder, level order) and construct a binary tree from preorder and inorder sequences.

Approach:
- Created a Node class to represent binary tree nodes.
- Implemented recursive methods for preorder, inorder, and postorder traversals.
- Used a queue and iterative logic for level order traversal.
- Wrote a constructor using preorder and inorder sequences to rebuild the tree.

Challenges:
- Ensuring recursion was implemented correctly and returned accurate results.
- Handling edge cases like empty trees or skewed trees.

Solutions:
- Tested each function with both simple and complex tree structures.
- Used a modular structure for better readability and reusability.

Conclusion:
All traversal functions returned expected sequences. The tree reconstruction function also correctly rebuilt the binary tree. This assignment helped reinforce understanding of tree structures and traversal logic.
